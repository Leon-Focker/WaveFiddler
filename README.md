# WaveFiddler
WaveFiddler is a command line application for creative conversions between audio and image files.

## Currently supported conversions:
- From .wav to one image (.jpg or .png) with variable FFT size.
- From .wav to an image sequence, which will be in sync with the audio file when played at the given frame rate (can be set).
- From an image (.jpg or .png) to a wavetable (.wav) with one frame.
- From an image (.jpg or .png) to a wavetable (.wav) with multiple frames.
